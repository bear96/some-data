1. **Hush Money Payments**: During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged payments to Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels to keep silent about their alleged affairs with Trump in 2006-2007. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, stating he did so at Trump's direction to influence the election. Trump denied affairs but later admitted to reimbursing Cohen. Prosecutors investigated Trump's involvement, with ongoing legal actions suggesting potential cases against him.

2. **Russian Election Interference**: U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump. Trump campaign members had suspicious links to Russian officials. Manafort, a campaign manager, had ties to pro-Russian politicians. Flynn, Stone, and others were also connected to Russia. Flynn resigned over discussions with Russian officials. Trump promoted conspiracy theories blaming Ukraine for election interference, which aligned with Russian narratives. The FBI investigated these connections, including the Crossfire Hurricane and counterintelligence inquiries.

3. **Mueller Investigation**: Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian interference and potential collusion with the Trump campaign. The investigation also examined obstruction of justice allegations and other countries' ties to the campaign. Mueller found extensive Russian interference but didn't establish conspiracy with the Trump campaign. The report detailed potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not make a prosecutorial judgment. Congress was suggested to determine further action. Several Trump associates were convicted in connection to the investigation, but Trump repeatedly claimed exoneration.
