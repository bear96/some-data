The COVID-19 outbreak, originating in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, swiftly spread worldwide, reaching the United States by January 2020 and prompting a public health emergency declaration by the end of that month. President Trump's handling of the crisis came under scrutiny as he publicly downplayed its severity while privately acknowledging its seriousness, sparking criticism. The initial response was marked by delayed action and a focus on economic and political considerations rather than the health threat, leading to significant financial market downturns by mid-March. Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force in January 2020, holding daily press conferences where he sometimes promoted unproven treatments and criticized his handling of the pandemic. Additionally, he clashed with the World Health Organization (WHO), withdrawing funding and accusing the organization of mismanagement and Chinese influence. Controversies emerged regarding testing, with Trump suggesting fewer tests to lower reported cases and political interference in CDC guidelines. Despite contracting COVID-19 himself and experiencing a severe case, Trump continued to downplay the virus's seriousness, facing pressure to lift pandemic mitigation measures and often refusing to wear masks in public. The handling of the pandemic became a central issue in the 2020 presidential election, with polls indicating widespread public disapproval of Trump's response.
