Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he took several significant actions, including signing six executive orders. These orders covered a range of issues, including healthcare, trade, and immigration. Notably, Trump took steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare), withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstated the Mexico City policy, advanced construction projects for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and initiated plans for a border wall with Mexico.

Additionally, Trump appointed his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner to prominent roles in his administration. Ivanka served as his assistant, while Kushner became a senior advisor. However, Trump's business interests raised concerns about conflicts of interest. Before taking office, he transferred his businesses to a trust managed by his sons, but continued to receive updates on their operations and profits. This led to lawsuits alleging violations of the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibit the president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. While some cases were dismissed, others were still pending at the end of Trump's term.
