Donald Trump's business career began in 1968 when he joined his father's real estate company, Trump Management. He later became president of the company and used the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand. Trump's real estate ventures included Manhattan developments like the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Trump Tower, as well as the Plaza Hotel. He also ventured into Atlantic City casinos, acquiring properties like Trump Taj Mahal. However, several of his businesses filed for bankruptcy, and he faced financial challenges throughout the years.

Trump expanded his business empire to include Mar-a-Lago, golf courses, licensing deals for consumer products, and side ventures like the New Jersey Generals football team and the Tour de Trump cycling race. He also engaged in stock transactions and owned the Miss Universe pageants.

In 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, which faced lawsuits alleging fraud and ultimately settled for $25 million. He also faced legal challenges related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which was dissolved in 2018 after allegations of self-dealing and tax evasion.

Throughout his career, Trump was involved in numerous legal actions, and several of his businesses filed for bankruptcy. Despite his financial setbacks, he continued to expand his business ventures until his presidency, after which some financial institutions, like Deutsche Bank, decided not to do business with him.
