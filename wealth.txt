Donald Trump's financial journey has been characterized by fluctuations in wealth, significant debt, and controversies surrounding his financial claims. In 1982, he made his debut on Forbes' list of wealthy individuals by holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth. However, subsequent losses during the 1980s led to his exclusion from the list until he claimed a net worth of approximately $10 billion in 2015.

Despite his claims of wealth, there have been disputes over the accuracy of Trump's financial representations. Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported an incident in the 1980s where Trump, using the alias "John Barron," allegedly misrepresented his wealth to Forbes in order to secure a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list. Additionally, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 revealed significant losses, surpassing those of most other taxpayers during that period.

Trump's narrative of starting his career with a "small loan" of $1 million from his father has also faced scrutiny. Reports suggest that Trump received additional financial support from his family's company, including loans totaling at least $60 million from his father. Furthermore, there are allegations of tax fraud related to Trump's financial activities, including underperformance in his investments compared to the stock and New York property markets.

In the 2010s, Trump's financial activities included deferring taxes on forgiven debt, balancing losses with income from ventures such as "The Apprentice," and leveraging assets through borrowing and selling. Despite his significant debts, which totaled over $1.3 billion as of October 2021, including substantial amounts owed to banks like Deutsche Bank and the Bank of China, Trump's assets were reported to exceed his liabilities as of 2020.

Overall, Trump's financial history is marked by a complex interplay of wealth accumulation, debt acquisition, and controversies surrounding his financial claims and practices.
