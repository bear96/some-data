**Books:**

Using ghostwriters, Trump has produced up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics under his name.[127] His first book, *The Art of the Deal* (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by Tony Schwartz.[128] According to *The New Yorker*, "The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon."[128] Trump has called the volume his second favorite book, after the Bible.[129]

**Film and television:**

Trump made cameo appearances in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[130]

Trump had a sporadic relationship with the professional wrestling promotion WWE since the late 1980s.[131] He appeared at WrestleMania 23 in 2007 and was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013.[132]

Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[133] He also had his own short form talk radio program called *Trumped!* (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[134][135] From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on *Fox & Friends*.[136][137]

From 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows *The Apprentice* and *The Celebrity Apprentice*. Trump played a flattering, highly fictionalized version of himself as a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase "You're fired". The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide.[138][139] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million which he invested in largely unprofitable businesses.[140]

In February 2021, Trump resigned from the Screen Actors Guild he had been a member of since 1989 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his "reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists".[141] Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission.[142]
